The executives will have GUI based login capabilities. They will be set up with mail accounts and those accounts will be connected to Thunderbird on their executive systems. We also need a Windows 2016 Base Instance with Containers deployed to AWS for a special project. Including a functional SOP. Demonstrate tool-based provisioning of the required OS.
